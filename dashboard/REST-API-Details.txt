Details on the structure of our REST API

Issues to consider:
    - How to choose what to query
    - return blocks or individual values?
    - how deep can calls go (level of detail)?


current allowed depth = 3;

/data/#CATEGORY
    - Category can be pressure, temperature
        - could use label for the entire block in REST call?
    - If we get data back as a brick then it needs to be broken apart
    - depth is important

/control/#INDIVIDUAL_MODULE
    -

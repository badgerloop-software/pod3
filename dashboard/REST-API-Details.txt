Details on the structure of our REST API

Issues to consider:
    - How to choose what to query
    - return blocks or individual values?
    - how deep can calls go (level of detail)?


current allowed depth = 3;

/data/#CATEGORY
    - Category can be pressure, temperature
        - could use label for the entire block in REST call?
    - If we get data back as a brick then it needs to be broken apart
    - depth is important

/control/#INDIVIDUAL_MODULE



Sending a file steps:
    1. Make request to server with the file name
    2. Server receives filename
    3. Server requests file from localhost
    4. localhost processes request with filename, sends file over stream
    5. server receives and saves file

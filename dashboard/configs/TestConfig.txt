Put a file you want to transfer here! Run this on your server:

---------------Example Server Side Code Below----------------------------------

const events = require("events");
const fs = require("fs");

const app = express();

// Port can be whatever, but it must be different
// from the other port you use for other info
const port = 8009;

let message = "NULL";

const receivedEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
app.listen(port, () => console.log('example'));


// For the dash to transfer a file, it needs to open a connection
// and this server has to actually request the file, so when the dashboard
// says its going to transfer a file, first the server verifies that it's
// listening, then it requests for the dashboard to transfer the file

app.get('/config/:configName', (req, res)=> {
    let address = "http://" + req.hostname + ":" + (port) + req.path;
    console.log("Request for file transfer from: " + address);
    request(address, (err, res, body) => {
        receivedEmitter.emit("fileReceived", body);
    });
    res.send("Writing file");
});

receivedEmitter.on("fileReceived", (body) => {
    if(body.toString().includes("no such file or directory"))
        return;
    fs.writeFile(__dirname + "/transferredConfig.txt", body);
    console.log("File successfully written");
});
